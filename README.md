### Who am I?

Hey there, my name is Alessio and I am an Italian computer scientist living in the Netherlands.
I currently live in Amsterdam where I work at the Netherlands eScience Center as an eScience Research Engineer.
I have a BSc and MSc in computer science from the University of L'Aquila, an MSc in computer science from the VU Amsterdam, and a PhD in computer science also from the VU.

My research interests include auto-tuning and using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate scientific computation.
